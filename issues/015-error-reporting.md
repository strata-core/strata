# Issue 015: Error Reporting Polish

## Status: Planning

## Goal
Production-quality error messages with:
- Real source locations (not `{:?}` spans)
- Source code snippets with underline markers
- One-line "Help:" suggestions for common errors
- Consistent formatting across all error types

## Prerequisites
- None (can be done in parallel with other issues)

## Design Review: Not yet started
