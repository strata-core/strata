# Strata Charter (v0.1)

**Tagline:** Layered safety by design.  
**Essence:** Make system layers visible, verifiable, and harmonious.  
**Each line answers:** What (type), How (effects), Why (trace).

**Core principles:** effect-typed safety; capability security; supervised/structured concurrency; profiles (Kernel/Realtime/General); logic for explainability; deterministic replay; layered context sugar.

**Success metric:** An auditor can reconstruct behavior from effect traces alone.
